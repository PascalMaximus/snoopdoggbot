3. > Some Obscene Language

This bot is only intended for mature audiences farmiliar with the gangsta slang used by Snoop Dogg, and anybody under the age of 13 should not even think about using this bot without adult supervision.
Apologies if you are in any way offended by the explicit wording used in the translations.
The slanguage used in our algorithm has been quoted from Snoop Dogg himself and is commonly used in movies, conversations and music he has written.
These words are based on slang and can not be interpreted in any other way other than how they are quoted. There are no racist words used in the algorithm.
It's mad libs meets gangsta rap y'all.
